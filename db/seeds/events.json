Berklee is throwing an all-night hackathon to catalyze innovation in music therapy! $5000 grand prize! \r\n\r\n[Watch introduction video](http://www.youtube.com/embed/2XiswIWv88k)\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nMusic therapists help people access music, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, and use music to help them communicate, express themselves, and enhance their lives. This first-of-a-kind event will create a space for hackers to develop innovative tools for music therapists to use in therapeutic and healthcare settings. This Berklee Music Therapy Hack--cohosted by Berklee College of Music and hack/reduce--aims to create a new vision of what music therapy does and can do.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nPracticing music therapists and music therapy students will present hack participants with problems to be solved in real-life settings. Assisted by a group of expert mentors, teams will have 24 hours to prototype innovative ideas using state-of-the-art technology and tools. Teams will then present their projects to a distinguished panel of judges, who will ultimately award a $5,000 cash prize for the best hack. \r\n\r\n### When?\r\n\r\n3pm Friday, March 28, 2014 till\r\n8pm Saturday, March 29, 2014\r\n\r\n### Where?\r\n\r\nhack/reduce\r\n275 3rd Street\r\nCambridge, MA 02142\r\n\r\n### What should I build?\r\n\r\nCurious about the needs of music therapy?

    "description": "Join us for the Texas Conference on Digital Libraries' first-ever hackathon! We'll be developing tools that Texas libraries and others can freely use to power new and transformative explorations of our digitized cultural heritage, based on the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) API.\r\n\r\nDPLA is a platform that enables new and transformative uses of digitized cultural heritage materials, based on a metadata repository that provides read-only access to millions of records from across the United States via an open API. Texas content is currently provided by the Portal to Texas History at the University of North Texas, one of nine DPLA Service Hubs, and by content contributed by DPLA Content Hubs. In this workshop, participants will actively code against the DPLA API to build or enhance apps, visualization tools, plug-ins, and other interesting tools that make use of DPLA data.\r\n\r\nThe DPLA encourages the development of apps and tools by developers of all skill levels and backgrounds; there are no strict boundaries on the types of apps accepted, except that they be open source (the DPLA platform is released under a AGPLv3 license) and interoperable with the DPLA platform.  DPLA API queries are returned as JSON-LD, and the metadata is freely reusable under a CC0 public domain license. A front-end portal is currently available at <http://dp.la>; prospective workshop participants are encouraged to explore the portal to see what types of materials are available.\r\n\r\nThis FREE hackathon will provide some background on DPLA and the DPLA API, but it will not provide a structured introduction to programming. Active participation is highly desired, so workshop participants should have at least some prior experience of working with APIs or with interface development in PHP, Ruby, Python, or Java. Participants should provide their own laptop computers with appropriate development environments; power and wireless Internet access will be available courtesy of the Texas Digital Library and The University of Texas at Austin Libraries. \r\n\r\nTechnical Notes: The DPLA codex is available at <http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/>. Participants should request an API Key prior to the workshop at <http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/#get-a-key>. Please review the API Basics (<http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/api-basics/>) or browse the apps page (<http://dp.la/apps>) to see some examples of production apps. DPLA has made sample code and libraries for Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Node.js (<http://dp.la/info/developers/sample-code-and-libraries/>), which may provide a useful starting point for development. A troubleshooting and FAQ page (<http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/troubleshooting/>) is also available.",

Come to the BeMyApp Factory Hackathon and build a connected device! \r\n\r\nThis is a hackathon for inventors, builders, coders and designers who want to create a connected device, NOT for those who want to create an app for a current connected device - so no we won't have Glass, Pebble, UP, etc.\r\n\r\nThe winning team will get hands-on consulting sessions with 219 Design, a product video funded by us, help creating a beautiful prototype, media coverage and help from the BeMyApp Crew :) So, if you're passionate about what you'll be building, be ready for the chance to work hard to launch a crowdfunding campaign for your amazing product. By the way, commitment and dedication to continue the project will be on the judging criteria list. \r\n\r\nEven if you come with a team, you will still need to pitch your idea Friday night to get feedback from the mentors! Idea pitches need to be turned in by 3/20. Feel free to email/call before that to chat about your idea. \r\n\r\nIt’s ok for you to bring an idea that you’ve worked on, but you have to build a prototype from scratch during the hackathon. \r\n\r\nPlease BYOH, but as promised, we will also be hooking you up with components as well. Electric Imp, will have Imps for anyone who wants to use one for their project!  That being said, there are no requirements regarding what components you use-as long as you build a connected device of some sort! \r\n\r\nWe will have all the components on this list (https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/73653) as well as arduino boards, beacons and BL boards, and some other goodies. We will also have a couple soldering stations, an oscilloscope, a voltmeter, a logic analyzer, some wire strippers, a dremel and some hand tools (but please bring some if you have em!)  \r\n\r\nJust remember, we are not a store so we will not have everything you can think of. If you already know you need something specific, BRING IT! \r\n\r\nWe’re partnering with TechShop, Electric Imp, 219\r\nDesign, Whistle, MbientLab and SparkFun (so far!)  Big shout out to Sandbox Suites for hosting us! We cant wait to see what you crazy inventors get up to! ",

We engage the local community by bringing in engineers and designers who mentor these students over the course of a day and help them bring their ideas to life.\r\n\r\nThrough this process students learn how to think creatively, pitch and demo their projects, and more technical skills like how to code and design.

LJ Rich from BBC Click will be joining the hackathon, taking part and filming a special edition of the BBC Worldwide TV show as part of the event. We have musicians on hand to collaborate for performance-based hacks. We have free t-shirts and snacks.\r\n\r\nNow we just need you. Sign up here to participate in the Music Tech Fest Boston Hackathon. We’re going to get together on Friday the 21st for a briefing at 2pm at Microsoft Research - and then the hackathon commences at noon on Saturday. See you there!",

Berkeley and Earlham have already done their part, let's make sure GT does its!\r\n\r\n\\-===\r\n\r\nThis will be a Code for Good Hackathon using Intel's newest hardware and software tools for expanding the Internet of Things. It will feature coding on the Galileo board and access to data processing through the Cloud.  The Hackathon will have a Code for Good Theme based on disaster response and recovery. Subject matter expertise will be provided by UNICEF -- including guidance from the Innovation in Humanitarian Action Program at UNICEF as well as UNICEF Chile and South Sudan. \r\n\r\nThis is a simultaneous, multi-site Hack-for-Good event,  with students at UC Berkeley, Earlham College, and Georgia Tech all working on the same platforms.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the disaster response challenge will be highlighted by Professor Peck from Earlham College, who has more than 25 years real-life experience as a first responder, as well as being the co-organizer for the Earlham site.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia Hackathon will be hosted by Dr. Matthew Wolf, with resources and expertise provided through CERCS.  The Berkeley Hackathon will be hosted by the Intel Software Student Community Manager, Paul Steinberg, in collaboration with the Computer Science Undergraduate Association of Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThis hackathon will take place in Klaus Advanced Computing Building (KACB).  It will begin **March 1st** at 9:00 AM and finish Sunday evening.\r\nIntel will be providing each site with 10 Galileo boards, complete with dev kits (cables, Arduino Uno R3 sensors, and more). Each team of 4-5 students will be able to work with their own board. [Here's a link](http://arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelGalileo#.Uw6W7_RdVQU) with more info about the board, and [here's another one](https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-22192) from Intel with beginning tutorial information.\r\n\r\nIntel is also providing prizes and food.  There will be three raffle pools -- those who attend on Saturday, those who attend on Sunday, and those who attend both days.  We'll have Galaxy Tab 3's, Amazon gift certificates, and even some of the Galileo boards to give away!\r\n\r\nCome to learn, come for the food, come for the cool prizes, **come to help those who will be in need**.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can follow the on-going efforts [over on the cercs-ed activities page](http://cercs-ed.gatech.edu/activities/IoTHackathon_blog_Spring2014) for the hackathon!",
